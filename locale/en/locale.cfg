[map-gen-preset-description]
pyblock-recommended=These are the recommend settings for playing PyBlock. Resources, trees, rocks, cliffs, and most land are disabled.\nIf you want to play with more land, increase the island size or switch to normal terrain generation.
pyblock-classic=This is classic PyBlock. Resources, trees, rocks, cliffs, and most land are disabled. You start on a single tile of landfill and must build the world as you go.\nIf you want to play with more land, switch to PyBlock Recommended preset from the dropdown above.
pyblock-archipeligo=This is a variation of pyblock where small islands generate, occasionally containing useful resources, but must of your production comes from normal PyBlock methods. 
default=[color=red]This preset is not recommended for PyBlock, consider using the [/color]PyBlock Recommended[color=red] preset from the dropdown above.[/color]

[messages]
pyblock-warning-no-preset=It looks like you are not using a 'PyBlock' map generation preset. PyBlock has been developed and balanced around not mining resources, but it is still playable on a normal map.\nIf you still want to mine some resources while playing PyBlock, then check out the PyBlock Archipeligo preset.
pyblock-intro=You have crashed on a planet almost completely covered in water. Perhaps you're doomed... or perhaps there's enough here to scrape by.
