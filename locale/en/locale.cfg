pyblock-recommended=These are the recommend settings for playing PyBlock. Resources, trees, rocks, cliffs, and most land are disabled.\nIf you want to play with more land, increase the island size or switch to normal terrain generation.
pyblock-classic=This is classic PyBlock. Resources, trees, rocks, cliffs, and most land are disabled. You start on a single tile of landfill and must build the world as you go.\nIf you want to play with more land, switch to PyBlock Recommended preset from the dropdown above.
pyblock-archipeligo=This is a variation of pyblock where small islands generate, occasionally containing useful resources, but must of your production comes from normal PyBlock methods. 
pyblock-landblock=This is a variation of pyblock where normal terrain generates, but no resources. Build up using normal PyBlock technology with none of the space constraints! 
default=[color=red]This preset is not recommended for PyBlock, consider using the [/color]PyBlock Recommended[color=red] preset from the dropdown above.[/color]

[messages]
pyblock-warning-no-preset=It looks like you are not using a 'PyBlock' map generation preset. PyBlock has been developed and balanced around not mining resources, but it is still playable on a normal map.\nIf you want to play on normal land but with PyBlock tech, use the PyLandBlock preset.\nIf you still want to mine some resources while playing PyBlock, then check out the PyBlock Archipeligo preset.
pyblock-intro=You have crashed on a planet almost completely covered in water. Melon went a little overboard with nuclear artillery...\nEverything is gone, but you're here now. Perhaps you're doomed... or perhaps there's enough here to scrape by.
pyblock-spoilage-warning=Warning: Mod 'Module Inserter' not found! It is highly recommended that you use this mod since seaweed spoils!
pyblock-new-save-warning=Warning: This version of the PyBlock changes many aspects of the game, particularly the early game (Start - Py1). It is highly recommended that you backup your game in case you do not wish to continue in this version!
